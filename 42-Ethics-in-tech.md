# Ethics in Tech

## [The code I’m still ashamed of](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e/)

- think the most important take-away from this essay is that questionably ethical items won't have a big flashing red siren go off when they happen, there won't be any forewarning. Your company won't have a long internal debate on the ethics of it.
- It will be passed as just routine and a normal part of the process. It'll be "just the way things are done". It'll still be up to you to understand and appreciate the ethical consequences of you choices.

## [Will democracy survive big data and AI?](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/will-democracy-survive-big-data-and-artificial-intelligence/)

- As smart devices become smarter and take strides towards sentience, it is our responsibility to mitigate the risks associated with big data and artificial intelligence. Companies are profiting from big data, supercomputers are surpassing the capabilities of humans, and jobs are rapidly being replaced by machines. Although innovation and technology have potential catastrophic consequences, we can’t ignore the potential benefits. Modern technology has created a global community and now more than ever, we have the tools and capability to come together for massive transformative change.. I strongly believe that humanity needs to be strategic and responsible when it comes to future innovation.
