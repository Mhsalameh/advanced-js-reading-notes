- Building a react native app:

  - Install react native and react.
  - import { Text, View, StyleSheet, Button } from 'react-native'
  - `<View></View>` with style attribute: renders a container.
  - `<Text>` Test goes Here `</Text>`: render a text.
  - `<Image></Image>`
  - StyleSheet.create()

- React Native provides a number of built-in Core Components ready for you to use in your app. You can find them all in the left sidebar (or menu above, if you are on a narrow screen). If youâ€™re not sure where to get started, take a look at the following categories:

  - Basic Components Most apps will end up using one of these basic components.

  - View The most fundamental component for building a UI.

  - Text A component for displaying text.

  - Image A component for displaying images.

  - TextInput A component for inputting text into the app via a keyboard.

  - ScrollView Provides a scrolling container that can host multiple components and views.

  - StyleSheet Provides an abstraction layer similar to CSS stylesheets.
